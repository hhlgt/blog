## Usage of shell script

> References: [Learn Shell](https://www.learnshell.org/), [Shell 教程 | 菜鸟教程 (runoob.com)](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-shell.html)

The first line of shell script file begins with `#!`, followed by the full path where the shell interpreter is located. For example,

```shell
#!/bin/bash
```

To find out the currently active shell and its path, type the commands followed,

```shell
ps | grep $$
which bash
```

### 1 Variables

- Variable name can consist of a combination of letters and the underscore "_".
- Value assignment is done using the "=" sign and there is no space permitted on either side of = sign when initializing variables.
- A backslash "\\" is used to escape special character meaning. (转义特殊字符含义)
- Encapsulating the variable name with ${} is used to avoid ambiguity.
- Encapsulating the variable name with "" will preserve any white space values

*Example*

```shell
BIRTHDATE="Dec 13, 2001"
Presents=10
BIRTHDAY='date -d "$BIRTHDATE" +%A'

if [[ "$BIRTHDATE" == "Dec 13, 2001" ]]; then
	echo "BIRTHDATE is correct, it is ${BIRTHDATE}"
fi
if [[ $Presents == 10 ]]; then
	echo "I have received $Presents presents"
fi
if [[ "$BIRTHDAY" == "Thursday" ]]; then
	echo "I was born on a $BIRTHDAY"
fi
```

#### special variables

- `$0` - The filename of the current script.
- `$n` - The Nth argument passed to script was invoked or function was called.
- `$#` - The number of argument passed to script or function.
- `$@` - All arguments passed to script or function.
- `$*` - All arguments passed to script or function.
- `$?` - The exit status of the last command executed.
- `$$` - The process ID of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
- `$!` - The process number of the last background command.

### 2 Passing Arguments

The `i-th` argument in the command line is denoted as `$i`， `$0` references to the current script, `$#` holds the number of arguments passed to the script，`$@` or `$*` holds a space delimited string of all arguments passed to the script.

*Example*

```shell
# function
function File {
	# print the total number of arguments
	echo $#
}

# '-lt': less than 
if [[ ! $# -lt 1 ]]; then
	File $*
fi
```

### 3 Array

- An array is initialized by assign space-delimited values enclosed in ().
- The total number of elements in the array is referenced by `${#arrayname[@]}`.
- Traverse all the elements in the array is referenced by `${arrayname[@]}`.
- The array elements can be accessed with their numeric index. The index of the first element is 0.
- Some members of the array can be left uninitialized.
- The elements in array can be compared with elements in another array by index and loops.

*Example*

```shell
# arrays
fruits=("apple" "banana" "tomato" "orange")
# The total number of elements in the array is referenced by ${#arrayname[@]}
echo ${#fruits[@]}
fruits[4]="watermelon"
fruits[5]="grape"
echo ${fruits[@]}
echo ${fruits[4]}
```

### 4 Basic Operators

- **a + b** addition (a plus b)
- **a - b** substraction (a minus b)
- **a \* b** multiplication (a times b)
- **a / b** division (integer) (a divided by b)
- **a % b** modulo (the integer remainder of a divided by b)
- **a** ****** **b** exponentiation (a to the power of b)

*Example*

```shell
# basic operators
A=3
B=$((12 - 3 + 100 * $A + 6 % 3 + 2 ** 2 + 8 / 2))
echo $B
```

### 5 Basic String Operations

- String Length: `${#stringname}`

- Find the numerical position in `$STRING` of any single character in `$SUBSTRING` that matches. 

  - ```shell
    expr index "$STRING" "$SUBSTRING"
    ```

- Substring Extraction

  - Extract substring of length `$LEN` from `$STRING` starting after position `$POS`. Note that first position is 0.

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING:$POS:$LEN}
      ```

  - If `$LEN` is omitted, extract substring from `$POS` to end of line.

    - ```
      echo ${STRING:2}
      ```

- Substring Replacement

  - Replace first occurrence of substring with replacement

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]/substring/newsubstring}
      ```

  - Replace all occurrences of substring

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]//substring/newsubstring}
      ```

  - Delete all occurrences of substring (replace with empty string)

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]// substring/}
      ```

  - Replace occurrence of substring if at the beginning of `$STRING`

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]/#substring/newsubstring}
      ```

  - Replace occurrence of substring if at the end of `$STRING`

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]/%substring/newsubstring}
      ```

  - Replace occurrence of substring with shell command output

    - ```shell
      echo ${STRING[@]/%substring/$(shell command)}
      ```

  *Example*

  ```shell
  # string operation
  STRING="this is a string"
  echo "The length of string is ${#STRING}"
  #Find the numerical position in $STRING of any single character in $SUBSTRING that matches
  SUBSTRING="hat"
  expr index "$STRING" "$SUBSTRING" # 1 't'
  # substring extraction
  POS=5
  LEN=2
  echo ${STRING:$POS:$LEN}
  echo ${STRING:10}
  # substring replacement
  STRING="to be or not to be"
  # replace the first occurrence
  echo ${STRING[@]/be/eat} 
  # replace all occurences
  echo ${STRING[@]//be/eat} 
  # the begin
  echo ${STRING[@]/#be/eat now}
  # the end
  echo ${STRING[@]/%be/eat}
  echo ${STRING[@]/%be/be on $(date +%Y-%m-%d)} 
  ```

### 6 Decision Making

#### 6.1 If-else

```shell
if [ expression1 ]; then
	#statement1
elif [ expression2 ]; then
	#statement2
else
	#statement3
fi
```

#### 6.2 Types of numeric comparisons

```shell
$a -lt $b    $a < $b
$a -gt $b    $a > $b
$a -le $b    $a <= $b
$a -ge $b    $a >= $b
$a -eq $b    $a is equal to $b
$a -ne $b    $a is not equal to $b
```

#### 6.3 Types of string comparisons

```shell
"$a" = "$b"     $a is the same as $b
"$a" == "$b"    $a is the same as $b
"$a" != "$b"    $a is different from $b
-z "$a"         $a is empty
```

#### 6.4 logical combinations

`&&`, `||`, `!`

#### 6.5 case structure

```shell
case "$variable" in
    "$condition1" )
        command...
    ;;
    "$condition2" )
        command...
    ;;
esac
```

### 7 Loops

```shell
# bash for loop
for arg in [list]
do
 command(s)...
done
# bash while loop
while [ condition ]
do
 command(s)...
done
#bash until loop
# basic construct
until [ condition ]
do
 command(s)...
done
```

- `break` and `continue` can be used to control the loop execution of for, while and until constructs.

### 8 Shell Functions

```shell
function function_name {
  command...
}
```

### 9 Trap Command

It often comes the situations that you want to catch a special signal/interruption/user input in your script to prevent the unpredictables.

Trap is your command to try:

- `trap <arg/function> <signal>`

*Example*

```shell
trap "echo Booh!" SIGINT SIGTERM

function booh {
    echo "booh!"
}
trap booh SIGINT SIGTERM
```

### 10 File Testing

| -e filename     | if file exist                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **-r filename** | **if file exist and has read permission for the user running the script/test** |
| **-w filename** | **if file exist and has write permission for the user running the script/test** |
| **-x filename** | **if file exist and is executable**                          |
| **-s filename** | **if file exist and has at least one character**             |
| **-d filename** | **if directory exist**                                       |
| **-f filename** | **if file exist and is normal file**                         |

### 11 Pipelines

```shell
command1 | command2
```

### 12 Input and Output Redirection

```shell
command > file  # Redirect the output to file.
command < file  # Redirect the input to file.
command >> file # Redirect the output to file appends.
n > file  # Redirect the file with descriptor 'n' to file.
n >> file  # Redirect the file with descriptor 'n' to file appends.
n >& m  # Merge the output files m and n.
n <& m	# Merge the input files m and n.
```
